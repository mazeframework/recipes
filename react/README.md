## preact_redux

A React/Redux SPA using the [Preact](https://preactjs.com) library.
Preact is a Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
The amber backend serves both html and json.  Also includes a JWT authorisation
pipe in src/pipes.  Create a new amber app with this template with these commands;

```
amber new mynewapp -r react/preact_redux
cd mynewapp
amber g auth User
```
Notes:  yarn or npm install issue warnings about unmet dependencies for react.  this
is normal as react is provided by preact via the preact-compat shim.  Remove the
Authenticate pipe from config/routes.cr after generating the auth plugin.  Remove the
AuthenticateJWT pipe from config/routes.cr if authentication is not required.


## preact_streaming

A React/Redux SPA with the same features as preact_redux with the addition of streaming changes to
database entries.  As database entries for a model are added/deleted and modified, a copy of the change
is sent to all connected cients that are viewing the index list of the model.
